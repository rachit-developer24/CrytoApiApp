# CryptoTracker: SwiftUI Cryptocurrency Explorer

A modern cryptocurrency tracking application built with SwiftUI that fetches real-time data from the CoinGecko API. This app demonstrates clean architecture principles, asynchronous API integration, and responsive UI design.

## Features
- Fetches and displays top cryptocurrencies by market cap
- Detailed view for each coin with comprehensive descriptions
- Error handling with custom error types
- Asynchronous data loading with Swift concurrency
- MVVM architecture with ObservableObject pattern
- Navigation using SwiftUI NavigationStack

This project showcases proper implementation of network requests, JSON parsing with Codable, and state management in a SwiftUI application. The modular architecture separates concerns between data models, service layers, and view models.
